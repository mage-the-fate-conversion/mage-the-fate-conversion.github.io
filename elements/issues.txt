# Issues

While I find mage fantastic, and rarely made house rules in the period of 20 years of playing it, now that I have drawn a critical eye at it, I do have some things I'd like to change given this opportunity.

### Spheres are ubiquitous in the game and effectively make up the base paradigm.
Mage is about divergent paradigms, but all paradigms work the same way.  Technically, a Verbena Forces weather mage can control a computer by controlling its electric circuits.  Similarly, a Virtual Adept computer hacker can 
summon lightning, all because they both have forces.  This has struck me as inherently flawed.  If belief/paradigm really determine's one's magical ability, then those abilities should differ as wildly as the different paradigms do.
In canon, the Spheres were supposed to be a Hermetic construction that served to organize magic neatly.  It may have worked well politically to create nine Traditions and divide the spheres among chosen Crafts, but I can't see
the Traditions using the Spheres as anything more than a talking point.

To remedy this, we've retooled the magic system to cater more towards the individual mage.   For starters the Spheres are just suggestion among any magical system, which can be combinations, supersets, and/or 
subsets of individual Spheres.  To make this work, we homogenized the magic system into target difficulties and modifiers that represent the different levels of a Sphere.  It does mean that a novice mage can technically summon
a fireball, or shapeshift into a dragon, but becomes highly unlikely as the difficulties for those tasks are generally out of their reach.

### It's possible to ignore paradox altogether
In the standard Mage, it's very possible to play without paradox.  I've had games where it never came up, and (at least for me personally) can be hard to remember.  In this conversion, Paradox deals consequences and have 
a more mechanical usage.  They can be targeted, compelled, and used as any other aspect in the game.
