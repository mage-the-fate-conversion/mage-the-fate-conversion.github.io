Why?

Mage has been my favorite of games for a very long time.  It, as with World of Darkness games in general, was one of the first to emphasize story over mechanics.  Among WoD games, it stood out as the game of limitless possibilities.
It's magic system was revolutionary and connected real world mythology into a game about people.  It was the ideal humanist game.

Since the 20 years that Mage first arrived, a lot has changed in the gaming world, and there are new directions in gaming that use the mechanics to highlight the story instead of modeling 'realistic' interactions.  Such a system is Fate.
Fate in particular emphasizes player agency, the idea that a player has the ability to influence the story and the story's direction beyond just their character's interaction.  This seemed a good marriage to Mage, a game about human potential.
Our hope is that when Mage and Fate combine, the player and storyteller feel empowered to together create meaningful characters and stories with the widest of berths of possibility.

As good as Mage is, it's not perfect and we've had several [issues](#issues) with how the setting and rules match up.  We've decided to change some pretty big things in the game in an effort to make it fit Fate, and to make the system more cohesive with the setting.
