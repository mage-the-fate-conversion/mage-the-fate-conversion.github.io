Backgrounds from classic Mage are hard to translate directly.  Below are the representations of the backgrounds for this Fate conversion.  Some become aspects as they're best represented as a narrative advantage.   Some are already represented as skills.  The last category, the ones that are represented by extras are unique in that they are represented by extensions to the rules.

### Aspect driven backgrounds

* Allies
* Avatar 
* Dream 
* Destiny 
* Influence 
* Mentor 
* Library - In classic Mage the library was used to shave experience points off Sphere purchases.  Being that Fate doesn't have experience points, the Library becomes a research boosting aspect.

### Skill driven backgrounds

* Contacts - see Fate Core p. 100
* Resources - see Fate Core p. 122

### Extras driven backgrounds

* Sanctum - 1 Refresh point - Any magic cast within a sanctum will not incur Paradox from vulgar magic or witnesses.  Magic in a sanctum can still incur paradox when the mage pushes themselves to get extra * shifts to their casting.

* Wonder/Fetish/Spellbook

* Talisman - 

* Node - 

* Arcane - Stunt - For every refresh point spent it gives the character a +1 on all stealth rolls and a +1 to the target of any attempt to notice the character.

* Familiars
